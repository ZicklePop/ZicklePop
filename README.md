### ðŸŒ¸ Melanie Kat ðŸŒ¸

Hi, my name is Melanie and my pronouns are she/her. I like to code in JavaScript with React and Next.js. I have a few personal projects here on GitHub that I've made for fun in my spare time.

I have been outspoken about GitHub's rampent sexism in the press. I think GitHub should stop profitting off racism by cutting off ICE.
