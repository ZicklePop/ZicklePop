### ðŸŒ¸ Melanie Kat ðŸŒ¸

Hi, my name is Melanie and my pronouns are she/her. I like to code primarily in JavaScript with React and Next.js. I have quite a few personal projects here on GitHub that I've made for fun in my spare time.

I have been outspoken about GitHub's rampent sexism in the press. I also think GitHub should stop profitting off of racism by cutting off ICE.
